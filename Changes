Reviewed and updated README

Huge POD rewrite

Adding a small script that generates HTML from POD and applies CSS from CPAN. Useful for reviewing the POD before release.

Added a test for POD validation

Added an example file that can test GitHub Issues #8, #9, #10

GitHub [Issue #9] [Issue #10]  Fixed cell_props applied to a different row when 'Repeat Headers' is enabled

Introduced column_numbers variable to avoid using $record in a broader scope. Further improvement needed.

Header row height is copied to each new page when 'Repeat Headers' is enabled

Fixed messing up row height when repeat headers is enabled due to access by array index vs shift/unshift

Fixed row height for rows with text blocks

Headers_props variable has been wrongly initialised with 0 causing a copy of the first data row even when header props are not passed as parameter

Added initialisation of header props justify param so that column and cell properties are not affecting the default value.

Fixed an issue with messing up row properties when repeating the header row on each page.

Examples have been formatted.

One new example added (header.pl) for demonstrating how header row can be added to multiple pages.

No need to export variables. Added one more test.

Removed pad_w and pad_h local variable as useless

Fixed typo causing a bug with row_height param.
Added example file for row_height. To be used for writing a test.

Added POD for row_height param

Row counting should not be skipped if it is first row.

Added one more test(duplicates existing) but only to have base.

Extracted PDF::API2 Mock as a separate package.
Created New test with the very basics.
Create a new package that will hold predefined data for tests so it can be reused.

Fixed a variable that masks earlier declaration.

Fixed Issue #4 - Row height is calculated correctly depending on font size.
Some variables are renamed to more meaningful.
Row counting is done in a new way with single counter that is used for column and cell props retrieval.

Row height is now calculated for each row based on maximum font size from all cells.
Refactored some variable names and unified row counting during column size calculation phase.

Fixed doc details in POD

Cosmetic changes

Decreased indent and reduced if body.
For easier review, diff with whitespace changes disabled.

Added github url in readme

Added Default Values for next_h next_y parameters

Added Minimum value check for x y start_h start_y

Optimization for min row height calculations

Added 'new_page_func parameter'. This is should be a reference to function which is called every time when a new page needs to be created so the table can span.See online manual for more info how to use it.

Added Check if any text in sub text_block before spliting the parameter.

Fixed bug with infinite loop when spanning to a new page.

Splitting long words to parts because of breaking table cels

Parameter in text_block() 'parspace'  space before block start (paragraph).
So the first line will start and height $ybase $parspace. So is every next paragraph into the block.

Undocumented Parameter in text_block() 'indent'    indent of every line
Undocumented Parameter in text_block() 'flindent'  indent of first line
Undocumented Parameter in text_block() 'fpindent'  indent of first paragraph

The Above parameters are excluding each other in the following order: parspace,flindent,fpindent,indent 
The one that is found first and has valid value is beeing used

Parameter 'w' for table is not optional any more (could change)

Others that i dont remeber.
