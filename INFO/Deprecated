A list of DEPRECATED names and interfaces in PDF::Table. In most cases, these
are names that have been changed for simplification and consistency. The old
names will not be kept around forever, and will be removed AT LEAST two
(2) years after notice is given here. Where possible, when using the old names,
a warning notice will be given in a release at least six (6) months before the
old name is removed from the code.

It would behoove you to make a quick check of "INFO/Deprecated" at each release,
so that you don't end up getting caught flat-footed by the removal of a name, 
and have to scurry to update your code! Anything added to the deprecated list
should also show up in "Changes", giving you a "heads up".

The POD, examples, and t-tests have been updated to use the new forms. There
should not be any use of deprecated setting names anywhere.
